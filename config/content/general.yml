## Each section contains elements that can be sampled probabilistically 
## Descriptions are prompt-ready and will be inserted directly into LLM prompts
## _mutually_exclusive: true = exactly ONE item selected from section (weighted random choice)
## _mutually_exclusive: false = each item sampled independently (based on independent probability)
