Diagnosis & treatment History:\n63M Recurrent CRC, R1 resection\n\nPreviously on adjuvant FOLFOX for high-risk resected CRC, R1 resection\nAdmitted in Portugal w/ ascending cholangitis 3/2021. Imaging found hepatic duct stenosis 2 colonic mass - stented. EUS Bx: adenocarcinoma\nRight hemicolectomy + lymphadenectomy 22/5/21: grade 2 pT4N1 (4/18 LN) adenocarcinoma, R1 resection (mesenteric margin)\nAdjuvant CAPOX from 7/8/21 complicated by oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, hand-foot syndrome, fatigue\nAdmitted w/ influenza early-September 2021, commenced Tamiflu. Admitted 9/9/21 w/ neutropenic fever + dehydration. Several delays to chemo late-September due to blood counts then DNA\nSwitched to 5-FU/LV 12/10/21\n(5-FU at 75% C1), complicated by stomatitis during C2 (with 5-FU at 100%). 5-FU back down to 75% from C3,\nCompleted Adjuvant Chemo 28/3/2022\nAug 2022: Rad Onc RV for ?RT, not appropriate\n- PET/CT - suspicious for Lung met\nOct 2023: CT Chest confirms lung metastasis - MDM advised for palliative chemotherapy\n\nSignificant B/G:\nType 2 DM post-surgery, RA w/ L hip and R shoulder replacements, diverticulitis - sigmoid resection, appendectomy\n\nAllergies: Penicillin, Ciprofloxacin, ?NSAIDs, latex\n\nCurrently: Newly diagnosed recurrence on CT chest - For consideration of palliative chemotherapy\n\nPre- Clinic discussion with Dr Patel: As previously tolerated chemo poorly options are to either try chemo again (pending DPD testing) or refer to early phase clinical trials for ?PRECISION or could be a candidate for RT if not keen/fit for chemo\nDiscussed with Dr Chen - potentially amenable to SBRT but given the rapid progression maybe chemo would be the most appropriate, but happy to consider\n\nPreviously Standard DPD panel -\nno relevant sequence\nDPD not on EPIC - requested today\n\nAttended with daughter\nDiscussed lung PD with solitary nodule - was already informed that there was a suspicious nodule in the lung\nafter the PET\nDiscussed that we would like to proceed with chemo\nPatient clearly stated that he is not keen at the moment to have more chemo as he would like to prioritize his QoL but also needs more time to consider his options\nPreviously struggled to complete chemo\nDiscussed the option of clinical trials or SBRT if no other metastatic disease - he is keen to explore these options\nAlso agreed for DPD testing in\ncase he decides to go ahead with chemo in the future\nPS1 limited by hip pain\nOE no neurology\nPreviously under pain management team at Royal London - patient on ibuprofen PRN, states he has NSAID allergy which causes him gastric upset and dizziness\nAdvised to increase ibuprofen to 600mg TDS and I will refer to CPCT\nI will also request an MRI pelvis to exclude any tumour deposits\n\nPlan\nBloods + DPD testing today\nRepeat PET - I will email Dr Chen to please arrange an appointment with him to discuss SBRT\nMRI pelvis - no neurology, but ongoing hip pain\nReferral to early phase clinical trials ?PRECISION\nF2F in 3/52 to rediscuss treatment options based on the above
