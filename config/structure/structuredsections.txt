The liver demonstrates several small hypodense lesions which show no metabolic activity and are likely cystic in nature. A small right pleural effusion is noted without metabolic activity. No other metabolically active sites of disease identified. The stomach appears mildly thickened but without significant uptake.\nEUS performed 06.12.24 not formally reported\nCT chest/abdomen/pelvis 03.12.24 confirms circumferential thickening of the distal esophagus\n\nPMH\nType 2 diabetes diagnosed 2019\n- well controlled on metformin\nGERD for 15 years\n- on long term PPI therapy\nBarrett's esophagus diagnosed 2021\n\nMedication\nMetformin 1g BD\nOmeprazole 40mg OD\nNKDA\n\nFH\nFather - stomach cancer aged 72\nMother - pancreatic cancer aged 68\n\nSocial history\nTwo children aged 28 and 31\nEx-smoker (quit 2015)/ social alcohol\n\nRetired engineer\n\nHas completed family\n- no fertility preservation needed (post-menopausal)\n\nTreatment Plan\nNeoadjuvant FLOT chemotherapy x 4 cycles followed by surgery then adjuvant FLOT x 4 cycles\nNutritional assessment and dietitian input\nRepeat staging CT after 2 cycles\n\nClinical review\nPresented with progressive dysphagia over 3 months and unintentional weight loss of 8kg. Was initially treated for reflux but symptoms persisted prompting endoscopy which revealed the tumor as above. He has locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma with regional nodal involvement. His PET-CT reassuringly showed no distant metastatic disease though there are some benign appearing liver cysts and a small pleural effusion which will be monitored. He has been understandably overwhelmed by the diagnosis and has experienced significant anxiety about eating and nutrition. He has already been referred to dietetics and his MDT discussion is complete.\n\nWe discussed his diagnosis in detail and the role that\nperioperative chemotherapy has in improving outcomes. We reviewed the FLOT regimen and discussed expected response rates and the importance of completing treatment before surgery. He had done considerable research and we thoroughly reviewed potential side effects including nausea, neuropathy, and fatigue today. He has provided informed consent for treatment. His main symptom is difficulty swallowing solids though liquids pass reasonably well. He has lost further weight (2kg in past week). His employer has been notified and he is arranging medical leave. Nutritional support options including potential feeding tube were discussed and he will see dietetics urgently. He understands the importance of maintaining nutrition during treatment.\n\nHe requires staging laparoscopy before commencing treatment and surgical review has been requested. His baseline bloods show mild anemia which needs addressing. We will coordinate his treatment start date once staging is complete and I will contact him early next week to confirm all appointments are arranged.\n\nO/E PS1\nAbdomen\n- soft, non-tender\n- no palpable masses or hepatomegaly\n- weight 68kg (down from 78kg)\n\nNutritional supplements and antiemetic prophylaxis discussed.\nReferred for port insertion given difficult venous access.\n\nPlan\nDietitian urgent review\nStaging laparoscopy\n- await scheduling\nPort insertion prior to chemotherapy\nTc early next week to coordinate care\nTo commence FLOT chemotherapy within 2 weeks (after staging complete)\nSurgical consultation\n- arrange within next 10 days\nFBC, U&E, LFTs pre-chemo\nRepeat CT after cycle 2
